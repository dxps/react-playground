_to-be-detailed_

### Setup

1. Start the PostgreSQL database.

2. Use Node v18.
   1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and run `nvm use` while being in this `backend` folder.
   2. At the time of this writing, it crashes using Node.js v20, see [this](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/18084) issue.
