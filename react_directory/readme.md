# A Directory with React

This project was created while doing Manning's [A Directory with React](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/directory-with-react) liveProject.

There are things that are done differently than the liveProject material. These include:

-   Using Vite with SWC (instead of just Vite)
-   Using TypeScript (instead of JavaScript)
